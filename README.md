# FrikBot Waypoints for Quake

A directory of waypoint files for Quake servers running FrikBot.

These waypoints are compatible w/ any old version of FrikBot X, though I'm specifically using them w/ [FrikBot4](https://github.com/whipowill/quake-mod-frikbot4).

## About

I originally had these waypoints bundled w/ FrikBot4, but I decided it might make more sense to break them out into something separate.  I want these files to be easy to find by modders using their own versions of FrikBot, and I want it to be inviting for others to submit their own waypoint files.

The new 2021 rerelease of Quake uses the KEX engine, which comes w/ a whole new bot mod that uses a totally different waypoint format.  This repo is not for that.  If you're looking for 2021 waypoint files, checkout [JPiolho's Nav Depot](https://github.com/jpiolho/Quake-Nav-Depot).

## Contribute

If you've made improvements to an existing waypoint file, or you've created a new one, please submit a pull request so we can add it to this repo.
